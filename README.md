INITIAL BRANCH OWNED BY APPBREWERY, This fork is my modified rendition of the intended format/design pattern and functionality.

#  BMI Calculator
You as the user input your hieght and weight via scrollers on the initial interface of the program. Upon selecting your height and weight, once the calculate button is pressed, your BMI (Body Mass Index) will be given to you. according to where your approximated BMI is in reference to your hieght and weight, the app will present to you a screen infroming you if you are underweight, healthy weight, or overweight by presenting a new screen. The new screen will have a way to navigate back to the initial interface where you can reenter height and weight if you'd like to recalculate.

## Purpose
This app was a guided tutorial on understanding the concepts of inheritance with Swift structs and classes. It also demonstrated the utility of optional binding and optional chaining.

## What I Learned
- multi-screen app navigation via segues
- how classes and inheritance in Swift operate akin to classes in other languages I've learned like Java
- the difference between structs and classes (reference vs value)
- formatting strings in Swift (decimals)
- optional binding, optional chaining for variables whose values are not yet known and shall be determined via user input
